One of the most difficult parts in IT security is to get started. There are zillions of interesting topics all around, but if you are completely new in this area you can easily get lost. Fortunately, there are a massive number of security tools online that help you to solve complex problems faster and easier even if you do not understand all the backgrounds. Distirbutions like [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), for example, are heavily armoured by the most recent security tools to help you automatize your daily routines in penetration testing. Such tools, however, are not only for beginners.

As [Charlie Miller said in his interview](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-Charlie-Miller/) "security is best learned by doing.". Today, everybody is using security tools, because we do not have time to implement everything from scratch. At the same time, if a new problem emerges someone is going to release a tool very soon on GitHub. These tools are among the key driving forces of IT security. Experts like [j00ru](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-Mateusz-Jurczyk/) use all the classics such as [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) or [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda). Top CTF teams such as [CyKor](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-CyKor/) heavily use [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler), [Paros](http://tools.kali.org/web-applications/paros) and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/) for web challenges. Long story short, tools are essential in IT security.

All right, I have the tool, but how can I try it out?

As the question above says another problem is that the **use case** (e.g., network traffic to analyze a problem, memory snapshot to find a specific code loading technique) is missing most of the time. If we lack such use cases, the tool and the corresponding problem cannot be understood well. To create such use cases, however, is time consuming and requires good expertise. 


To resolve the issues above, we launch tutorials called [avatao Tools](https://avatao.com/#/tools) for various security tools with **real use-cases**. All the tutorials are created by field experts and provide a step-by-step description for a problem that a given tool tackles. At the same time, we provide all the corresponding use cases (e.g., files, prepared environments) where the advantages of a tool can be understood instantly.

Our first tutorials drives you through the [Unicorn CPU emulator framework](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/8e720072-9169-4d4c-9569-c330ce7fd947), the [sqlmap utility to exploit a massive range of SQL injection vulnerabilities](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/f2514fd7-689a-4156-86c2-bf47fcf80baf), and the [John the Ripper password cracker utility](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/93d404f9-47fc-4382-bc75-7fe4b4947095). Wireshark and nmap is coming soon.
