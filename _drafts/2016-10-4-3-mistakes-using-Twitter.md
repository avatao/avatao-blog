As a tech person I got all excited about the immerse possibilities of Twitter and Facebook to spread the word about our philosophy in avatao. That is to make every software developer and IT professional security-aware, to build more secure software and apps.

Yet, having no experience in online marketing or social media in general, I made some rookie mistakes when trying to express my/our thoughts.

Obviously, lot is happening on Twitter, so I started to follow some people I believed are key people in the IT security field. This way, I got to know their thoughts and came across of conversation they commented on.

Today, there was a question if security people are spending their time on the right things while there is such a shortage of ITsec professionals. This nicely resonated to the avatao mission and I jumped in to comment on how we plan to bring security into the mind of each and every IT professional to make them build more secure systems (since [universities don't really do that](http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/top-us-undergraduate-computer-science-programs-skip-cybersecurity-classes/d/d-id/1325024)). As the discussion went on, I got bashed by one participant with the following: "bored with being in cc for marketing spam. Unsubscribe."

This made me realize the rookie mistakes I made:

1. **Never tweet a company link!**
I jumped into the conversation by making a point I thought makes sense. I made reference to the avatao mission, user feedback and backed with a link to our website.  
Even if you add something useful to the conversation you join, **_never include a link to your company website_**. People consider it as marketing and kick you out from the conversation. Especially, if you repeat it several times.

2. **Don't use your company twitter account!**
I thought that commenting under the avatao twitter account would emphasize my point. But it truly backfired. Most of these key people used their personal account to share their thoughts, rant about issues and retweet interesting news.  
I realized that you should never use your company's twitter handle to mingle with open discussions. Even if you don;t share any links back to your company page. This will immediately put up the red flag.

3. **Don't include all commenters in a one-on-one discussion!**
I did get into an argument chain with one of the commenters, but included all participants in the replies. Nothing offending and I think we made valid points. Yet, when one of the commenters replied as above, I realized the hird mistake.  
Never reply to all commenter who was linked in the previous tweet. Reply only to the person, who makes a comment on your tweet. This will save the others from a discussion that they might not care of.

Finally, I deleted the tweets in this conversation and apologized for the tweet chain to the commenter on spam. I felt that this is the right way to fix the thing. The lesson I learned: **_Always be honest, fix mistakes and care about people!_**
