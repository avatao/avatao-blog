title: Your first avatao Tuesday
author: gabor

How to get started? I think this is the first question that people raise when they are about to learn computer security. This was my first question also as there are so many interesting topics that you would like to dig into from the very first moment. The rabbit hole, however, is really deep and if you cannot focus enough you'll get lost easily. That's why I believe that guidance and diligence are the keys to master a certain aspect of computer security. Guidance comes from friends, blogs, online courses, classrooms, IRC and so on, however, diligence is you. Nobody can help you as much as you can for yourself. On the top of these key attributes practice, practice and practice. You have to start right now, because this is the right moment. 

**Yes, your hands will be dirty, but this is the cost of the knowledge you envisioned.**

We, the team at avatao, raised the bar high, too. We are inviting you for a journey by releasing a new security challenge with a small guidance every Tuesday from now on. 

The challenges will touch different topics so as to see how wide the scale is. The only thing you need is determination even if you are entirely new to computer security. We will give you hints and recommended readings if you are entirely lost. 

All right, it's high-time to get started and [say hello to avatao Tuesday](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/ee29eaed-cd00-4a4d-b4bd-4e3cd83d714b/challenges/fa6e6174-2f17-11e6-bdf4-0800200c9a66)
