We tell you how the [!SpamAndHex](http://core.crysys.hu/) saga started. Here comes the second part of the story. (You can check the [first part of the story here](https://blog.avatao.com/How-SpamAndHex-became-top-hacker-team/).

The small group of people grew by the word-of-mouth and soon there were more than a dozen people regularly meeting every week to crack some of the challenges of previous CTF competitions: [Boston Key Party](https://twitter.com/bkpctf), [Hack in the Box](https://conference.hitb.org/), [Nuit du Hack](https://quals.nuitduhack.com/), [DefCon CTF](https://legitbs.net/), [HITCON CTF](http://ctf.hitcon.org/), [CSAW CTF](https://ctf.csaw.io/), [CONfidence](www.confidence.org.pl/ctf/), and more...

Besides checking out previous CTFs, they also started to survey available tools and tricks. Each week, someone presented a nice tool that was not necessarily mainstream [Gabor: need tool and ref] or a cool hack recently presented on a security blog [Gabor, put ref]. Soon they started to compete at more events and next year they became 23th at iCTF. Next year was a break-through, when the [team finished 2nd at the iCTF competition](https://ctftime.org/event/112). 

The team got very motivated and they spend the next two years with participating at almost all CTF competitions. This gave them the experience, the motivation and next year they won the [iCTF 2015 competition](https://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/), got into the [DefCon CTF Finals](https://legitbs.net/). Also they got ranked [5th at the world scoreboard of CTF team in 2015](https://ctftime.org/stats/2015). 

This success was not possible if there weren't for the young students who got sucked into the mesmerizing world of CTF competitions and hands-on hacking. Soon, these youngsters became pros and hacked shoulder-by-shoulder with the founding members. 

The hacking story continues and we started to [organize bootcamps for young students to get into IT security (in HU)](http://core.crysys.hu/bootstrapping-it-security/) with plenty of [avatao challenges](http://avatao.com).
