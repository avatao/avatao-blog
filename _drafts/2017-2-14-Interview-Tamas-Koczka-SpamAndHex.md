We are more than happy to welcome [Tamás Koczka (aka "KT")](https://twitter.com/koczkatamas) who is one of the oldest members of the CrySyS Student Core
so that of the !SpamAndHex team also. As the captain of !SpamAndHex and the main player of the team he took part approximately 80 CTF events (including 7 finals abroad), solving hundreds of challenges from various categories 
of information security. He currently works as a security engineer at [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com), a CrySyS spin-off, secure client-side encrypted 
cloud storage provider and as one of the earliest coworkers he helped providing real security and keeping their privacy to hundreds of thousands of users.

Here is his story.

<span class="post question">Gabor Pek (avatao): Tamás, you are one of those students who joined CrySyS Student Core 
at the very beginning. How did you feel when you got invitation into the CrySyS Studen Core?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: How did you feel when you first played on CTF games and how do you feel now? What has changed since your first 
 experiences?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: How do you see the CTF landscape in a few years time? The challenges are getting more and more cumbersome so 
it is really difficult to bootstrap for a beginner.</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: We played together on CTFs many times in the last couple of years and know that you 
are blazingly fast. How do you approach new and previously unknown problems?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: There is a huge need for experienced IT security experts. How do you think this gap could be filled? </span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: The IT security landscape has always been two-fold. A good expert has to be aware of both the offensive
and the defensive side of this story. How can you build the experience you gained from CTF games into your professional life as a software engineer?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: Contemporary services and software lack a security consciousness design and implementation in most of the cases. 
How do you think software and systems could be more secure in the long run?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>

<span class="post question">GP: In an idealistic world, let's say that from this very moment, all the software engineers
 will write secure code as they exactly know all the problems that can pop up in the code. Still, we have many legacy codes which are
 low-hanging fruits for a bit more experienced attacker. How do you think about those zillions lines of legacy code? What could be 
 a good approach to alleviate the attack surface they expose?</span>

<span class="post answer">Tamás: </span>


<span class="post question">GP: What do you think are the hottest security tools in 2017? Finally, what are your favourite security tools?</span>
